HTML/Ballot/Trusting version 0.01
=================================

    A simple module for inseucre web ballots.

    This is a very beta version that will mature over the
    next week or so.

    Features:

    *   a HTML page of voting options and one of the results of votes so far
        is generated from a single HTML template, and it is in these pages
        that ballot status is maintained, so no additional file access is
        required. This may be extended to include a ballot `time out'.

    *   HTML output into the template is minimal, but all unique entities
        are given a "class" attribute for easy CSS re-definitions.

    *   simple bar charts of results are generated using HTML. Options to
        have graphs based on single-pixels, or using the "GD" interface will
        arrive some time in the future.

    *   no test is made of who is voting, so users may vote any number of
        times, or may even vote (and surely will) thousands of times using a
        "LWP" hack. A more secure version is being constructed, which uses
        simple e-mail authentication of users, sending ony one voting
        password to any e-mail address: this may appear as
        "HTML::Ballot::MoreCynical".

    *	the sample_vote.pl script is a sample of a script that may
        by automatically generated in future versions.
